# Creating CRT Effects with Tailwind CSS

Want to add that retro computer vibe to your website? In this tutorial, we'll explore how to create a convincing CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) monitor effect using Tailwind CSS and custom animations.

## The Basic Structure

First, let's set up the basic structure for our CRT effect:

```jsx
<div className="relative">
  {/* Content */}
  <div className="relative z-10">
    {/* Your content goes here */}
  </div>
  
  {/* CRT Effects */}
  <div className="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full bg-[linear-gradient(to_bottom,rgba(0,0,0,0)_50%,rgba(0,0,0,0.3)_50%)] bg-[length:100%_4px] z-20 pointer-events-none animate-scanlines"></div>
  <div className="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full opacity-15 z-30 bg-white pointer-events-none animate-flicker"></div>
  <div className="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full bg-[radial-gradient(ellipse_at_center,rgba(51,255,51,0.1)_0%,rgba(51,255,51,0)_70%)] z-10 pointer-events-none"></div>
</div>
